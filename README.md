# recon
I created this wrapper to quickly and efficently display quick commands so that I can run my recon. There are tools out there that auto scans and saves the output into files. However I find that with those tools, its easy to miss things. However with this technique, the operator is still manually testing and can use any of these commands manually instead of set and forget. This was created with the OSWA course in mind. Note: All these payloads can be found online and freely distributed.
## Usage
**./recon.sh**
- Enter the target URL
- Enter in the IP Address
- Enter in the Session Token
- Enter in the Endpoint
## Outcome
This will display a list of commands for recon when testing web applications
